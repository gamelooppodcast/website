This is a long description of the first episode where we can use lots of detail (and it supports markdown, so pictures, code snippets, etc are all good).

This is some __bold__ text and here is some _italic_ text.

> Here's a block quote.

And here is a code snippet.

```
module.exports = config => {
  config.addPassthroughCopy("public");
  config.addPassthroughCopy("favicon.ico");
}
```
